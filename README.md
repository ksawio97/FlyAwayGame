This is my first game made in unity (flappy bird clone)

Fly Away is a simple and addictive 2D infinite-runner game with Pixel Art graphics. As a bat flying through a cave, your goal is to avoid the spikes and survive for as long as possible. The game is easy to learn, but challenging to master, with progressively harder levels that will keep you engaged. With its retro-style graphics and fun gameplay mechanics, Fly Away is a great choice for anyone looking for a fun and challenging game.
